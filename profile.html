        <p>Well, as soon as I graduated high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go.
        BUT I knew I wanted to do SOMETHING, and that something turned out to be the Marine Corps where I would become a Combat Engineer!</p>
        <p>I thought every aspect of the job was interesting, but one moment I came to the realization that I wanted more.
        This is the moment where I decided to pursue a career as a physician, specifically a specialization in neurosurgery as the brain has always interested me, and I wanted to strive for something challenging yet rewarding.</p><img src="kenya2Photo.JPG" alt="" class="float-right">
        <p>I started at a lesser known school, but I gave it my absolute all and transfered to Emory University, my dream school as it was known for it's pre-medicine program and medical school.</p>
        <p>As time passed, I gained a great deal of experiences that I will cherish throughout my life. The lifestyle I was living though wasn't feasible long-term as it took a toll on my physical and mental well-being.
        I knew I needed a change so I took a year off to focus on myself, TRAVEL, and brainstorm my next pursuit. I landed on the tech space and ever since I have been fully immersed in my studies in web development! </p>
